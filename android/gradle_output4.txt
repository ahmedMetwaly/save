this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's KGP version is 
typically defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (D:\sa
ve\android/settings.gradle), 
by a plugin with the id of or
g.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins 
block, your project was 
likely created with an older 
template version, in which 
case it is most likely 
defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (D:\save\an
droid/build.gradle) by the 
ext.kotlin_version property.

WARNING: We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 36

This Android Gradle plugin (8.6.0) was tested up to compileSdk = 35.

You are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer
Android Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 36.

If you are already using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin,
you may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdk = 36 is available.

For more information refer to the compatibility table:
https://d.android.com/r/tools/api-level-support

To suppress this warning, add/update
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=36
to this project's gradle.properties.
