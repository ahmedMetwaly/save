* Where:
Script 'C:\src\flutter\packag
es\flutter_tools\gradle\app_p
lugin_loader.gradle' line: 9

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred 
evaluating script.
> You are applying Flutter's 
app_plugin_loader Gradle 
plugin imperatively using 
the apply script method, 
which is not possible 
anymore. Migrate to applying 
Gradle plugins with the 
declarative plugins block: ht
tps://flutter.dev/to/flutter-
gradle-plugin-apply


* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace 
option to get the stack 
trace.
> Run with --info or --debug 
option to get more log 
output.
> Run with --scan to get 
full insights.
